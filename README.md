# secondChance
During my internship through i.c.stars, I was put in a group to create a platform for re-entry citizens. My partner and I decided to create a center for high quality employment for these individuals. I was delegated the landing, about, and opportunities page. That is what you will find here -- my partner and I are actively collaborating on this project as we speak.
